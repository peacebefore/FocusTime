# FocusTime

I built FocusTime in the context of [Mo Binni's](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/mo-binni/) Complete React Native Developer course on [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/). FocusTime follows the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), where you focus on a particular task or objective for a set amount of time in order to improve your attention and productivity.

This application provided an introduction to React Native so that I could become comfortable with the fundamentals prior to starting the main project of the course, which is the MealsToGo app. I could also use FocusTime in order to be more productive while completing the rest of the course.
